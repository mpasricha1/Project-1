<p>Oscar is a technology-driven, consumer-focused health insurance startup founded in 2012 and headquartered in New York City. Our goal is to make health insurance simple, transparent, and human. We need your help to do so.</p>

<p><strong>About this role:</strong></p>

<p>Oscar engineers work on some of the most challenging problems in tech — helping users navigate the complex health industry through beautiful user applications, elegant distributed system design, making sense of noisy data, statistical learning, and language theory. We invest in our people, our tools, and our processes with a goal of learning from one another.</p>

<p>We have management opportunities for engineering teams in the following areas: </p>

<ul><li>Provider Data</li><li>Claims Processing</li></ul>

<p><strong>Management at Oscar: </strong></p>

<p>People managers are also technical leaders at Oscar — it’s part of our cultural identity. As such, we aim to support managers such that half of their time can be spent directly making technical contributions on architectural plans, helpful code reviews, and writing their own code. A manager doesn’t have to be the strongest technical contributor on their team, but we expect managers to produce technical work at a senior level and to have a sense of what “good” technical performance looks like, at both the individual and team levels.</p>

<p>If people management is not for you, we support a parallel career track focusing on technical leadership without the management responsibilities. You can be a tech lead for a team or large project without being a manager, though the roles often overlap.</p>

<p><strong>Specific management responsibilities include: </strong></p>

<ul><li>Mentorship. Ensure everyone on your team is getting clear, constructive, and frequent feedback on their work and that they have the support they need to grow as technical contributors.</li><li>Career development. Understand the aspirations of your teammates and help them to lead the work they are most passionate about.</li><li>Team execution. You manage the performance of your team, which can be minimally defined as “ensuring the right goals for the team are established, and that they are met at the right time”.  But we’d really like you to help your team excel.</li></ul>

<p>You won’t be on your own. Engineering management is an important and complex role that we take very seriously at Oscar and we support each other to do it well.</p>

<p>You will report to our Senior Director of Engineering in our NYC office.</p>

<p><strong>About You: </strong></p>

<ul><li>You have 7+ years of software engineering experience, including prior management experience.</li><li>You make the people and teams around you better through mentorship, collaboration, and guiding developers towards best practices.</li><li>You believe that team performance is even more important than individual performance, and have experience managing high-functioning teams.</li><li>You understand the “inclusion” part of Diversity &amp; Inclusion and can help us maintain a great culture where the best ideas prevail.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Life at Oscar:</strong></p>

<p>At Oscar, being an Equal Opportunity Employer means more than upholding discrimination-free hiring practices. It means that we cultivate an environment where people can be their most authentic selves and find both belonging and support. We're on a mission to change health care -- an experience made whole by our unique backgrounds and perspectives.</p>

<p>We encourage our members to care for their whole selves, and we encourage our employees to do the same with comprehensive medical benefits, generous paid-time off, paid parental leave, retirement plans, company social events, stocked kitchens, wellness programs, and volunteer opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Reasonable Accommodation:</strong></p>

<p>Oscar applicants are considered solely based on their qualifications, without regard to applicant’s disability or need for accommodation. Any Oscar applicant who requires reasonable accommodations during the application process should contact the Oscar Benefits Team (accommodations@hioscar.com) to make the need for an accommodation known.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Transparency Policy:</strong></p>

<p>Oscar ensures that you won't be discharged or discriminated against based on whether you've inquired about, discussed, or disclosed your pay. Read the full policy <a href=""https://assets.ctfassets.net/plyq12u1bv8a/1rF5ZOK4Cc2wcKQqYMu86W/6a7f199b884d9f38395878c624fe8587/Oscar_Health_Pay_Transparency_Policy.pdf"">here</a>.</p>",Healthcare,Insurance,Tech,,,,New York,NY,Other,,,,,,,,

277,243503.0,Senior Level,"New York, NY",Algo Software Engineer (C++/Python),2020-03-20T23:04:01.202495Z,Data Science,1292.0,Hudson River Trading,,"<p><span>At HRT, we program computers to intelligently trade on the stock market. We make the world’s markets more financially efficient using smart algorithms. To get the job done, we hire some of the smartest computer scientists in the world to develop both our low latency trading platform and our massive distributed research platform. </span></p>

<p><span>Algo Software Engineers (AE) are programmers that are embedded in HRT’s trading teams and work hand-in-hand with Algo Strategy Developers (AD). Whereas ADs tend to use their math skills to make smarter strategies, AEs focus on the software that powers trading and research. Because of this close collaboration, AEs tend to be the type of engineers that thrive on constant interaction and discussion. Hearing how their most recently deployed system allowed for whole new types of research would make their week. AEs are the type of engineers that don’t mind juggling a few projects at once and have a varied portfolio of project types, from long-term ambitious new systems to fire-fighting live issues.</span></p>

<p><span>Our environment is particularly well suited to driven, self-motivated programmers. For one, the company’s Partners are all programmers. Team Leads spend a majority of their time doing technical work. Algo teams run on a very bottom-up approach that encourages everyone on the teams to come up with ideas and dictate the direction of each team together. Finally, there is very little emphasis placed on project management process (almost no meetings and no project managers) and there is a lot of emphasis placed on engineering process such as automated testing, design/code reviews, and technical training. </span></p>

<p><span>We are a Linux/Unix shop with a codebase written primarily in C++ and Python. If you are not a C++ or Python or Linux expert, that’s probably OK. We really care more about your technical fundamentals, practical experience and that intense desire to make things better for other people. That being said, we want someone who is familiar with a non-scripting language such as C++ or Java. </span></p>

<p><span>Here are a few examples of programmers who are currently AEs at HRT:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>When he’s not solving riddles and dancing salsa, David’s writing distributed computing APIs. He regularly solves bugs like “one out of a million jobs are dying on only these machines and only on Tuesdays”. He likes bridging the gap between Algo Strategy Developers and Systems Engineers to explore how to use distributed computing to run research. He really enjoys coming up with ways to make millions of jobs more efficient.</span></li>
<li><span>Kai came to HRT after 3.5 years of programming C++ at a company that provides large amounts of data to the finance industry. He plays several musical instruments and has tasted thousands of wines, yet he finds his work to be an even more rewarding experience. He builds tools to discover opportunities and aid live trading. He is excited about automating strategies and implementing ideas from his teammates, in addition to applying his technical skills to the world of trading.</span></li>
<li><span>Aaron started programming at age 5 and previously ran the research team at a music software company, bringing over 7 years of experience to HRT. He cooks and practices partner acrobatics in his free time. He gets joy from his teammates’ happiness when their research runs twice as fast, from building them tools that help them visualize their strategies, and from keeping code organized and maintainable. He's gotten coworkers from other teams involved in latency improvements to his group's live trading. He enjoys the collaborative environment and learning from his coworkers.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Culture:<br></strong><span>Hudson River Trading (HRT) brings a scientific approach to trading financial products. We have built one of the world's most sophisticated computing environments for research and development. Our researchers are at the forefront of innovation in the world of algorithmic trading. </span></p>

<p><span>At HRT we come from all sorts of backgrounds: mathematics, computer science, statistics, physics, and engineering. We’re a community of self-starters who are motivated by the excitement of being at the cutting edge of automated trading. Our culture celebrates great ideas whether they come from HRT veterans or new hires. At HRT we’re friends and colleagues, whether we are sharing a meal, playing the latest board game, or writing elegant code. We embrace a culture of togetherness that extends far beyond the walls of our office.</span></p>

<p><span>Seem like something you might be interested in? Our goal is to find the best people and bring them together to do great work in a place where everyone is valued. HRT is proud of our diverse staff; we have offices all over the globe and benefit from our varied and unique perspectives. HRT is an equal opportunity employer; so whoever you are we’d love to get to know you.</span></p>",Finance,Tech,,,,,New York,NY,Data Scientist,,,True,,,,,

285,2723203.0,Management,"Boston, MA","Senior Manager, Carbon Operations",2020-04-28T11:04:48.766222Z,Data Science,1501.0,Indigo,,"<p>Indigo is a company dedicated to harnessing nature to help farmers sustainably feed the planet. With a vision of creating a world where farming is an economically desirable and accessible profession, Indigo works alongside its growers to apply natural approaches, grow healthy food for all, and conserve resources for future generations. Utilizing beneficial plant microbes to improve crop health and productivity, Indigo’s portfolio is focused on cotton, wheat, rice, corn, and soybeans. The company is headquartered in Boston, MA, with commercial and customer service based in Memphis, TN. <a href=""http://www.indigoag.com/"">www.indigoag.com</a></p>

<p>Indigo Carbon and the broader Terraton Initiative is the most explicit expression of our sustainability goals yet. The Terraton Initiative is working to remove 1 trillion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, sequester it in agricultural soils, and by doing that, improve the health of the soil, the profitability of farmers, the quality of our food, and the health of our planet. This goal is massive, and it will require a diverse team to make it happen. If you’ve been looking for a disruptive, tech-enabled company with super talented people that is tackling thorny, ambiguous but incredibly inspiring problems, we’d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>This role is essential. A carbon credit or a carbon offset is, fundamentally, a data product. You can’t see it, touch it, or feel it. If we say <em>“this smallholder farmer in India removed 4 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere”</em>, that claim is only as good as the data we have to support it and how easily, accessibly, and clearly we package and communicate those data. The Senior Manager, Carbon Operations will help drive and own the quality, rigor, and credibility of our carbon claims.</p>

<p>She/he will play a critical role connecting (a) the teams that sell our credits (e.g., the teams that sell credits to businesses, consumers, governments, etc.) and (b) the teams that help create our credits (e.g., agronomists, data scientists, soil scientists, satellite/geospatial analysts, product managers, etc.). In a single day, you may ask yourself all of these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is a Fortune 50 company so interested in buying our credits? (i.e., you would work with our carbon offset sales team)</li>
<li>How can we make our soil sampling more cost effective? (i.e., you would work with our Innovation team)</li>
<li>How should we design the app that lets growers enter their own data accurately and quickly? (i.e., you would work with the product management team who develops farmer-facing applications)</li>
<li>What approaches can help earn the trust of a geographically distributed and sometimes risk-averse group of farmers?</li>
</ul>

<p>In this role, you will be responsible for helping us create the most credible, rigorous, transparent carbon offsets ever. It’s a dynamic role that requires both business pragmatism, technical aptitude, and an optimistic, can-do attitude: the question you will answer every day is “how can we make this work” not “why can’t this work” – and then you will have to build that solution in partnership with your colleagues.</p>

<p><em>Please note: you don’t have to be an expert in soil science, data science or satellite imagery analytics. We have teams that focus on that. All you have to be is excited to learn about those enough that you can apply a business lens to pressure testing technical ideas.</em></p>

<p>This role reports to Kari Hernandez, Director of Carbon Operations.</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Own significant workstreams and strategy within Carbon Operations; oversee the credibility, rigor, and transparency of Indigo’s carbon offsets/credits</li>
<li>Work across the full Carbon business team to own and constantly improve the end-to-end process for creating carbon credits, including all touch points with the myriad cross-functional teams that contribute (e.g., Soil Carbon Science, Agronomy, GeoInnovation, Data Science, Product Management, Engineering, etc.) to balance accuracy and cost</li>
<li>Use quantitative and qualitative methods to understand what matters to our growers and ensure that their needs and interests are reflected in all of our processes</li>
<li>Act as an “owner” of a grower’s cross-functional journey through Indigo to ensure simplicity, clarity, ease, and an overall positive grower experience</li>
<li>Develop and oversee processes that enable all cross-functional partners to stay informed and aligned, allowing for improvements to effectiveness and efficiency each time</li>
<li>Develop data-driven operations management tools that are useful to a variety of stakeholders and integrated throughout the relevant operation(s)</li>
<li>Represent the Carbon Operations team, the Carbon Business, and Indigo at internal and external events</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Competencies</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to lead both conceptual and analytical problem solving across a variety of topics and rapidly prioritize based on new information</li>
<li>Analytical, process-oriented thinker who can look at data, draw insights and implement changes to improve processes and grower experience simultaneously</li>
<li>Significant attention to detail, organizational skills, and passion for getting it right; ability to “roll up your sleeves to get things done”</li>
<li>Ability to interact with, mobilize, align, and inspire cross-functional teams, developing deep relationships over time and helping each group understand their critical points of intersection</li>
<li>Excellent verbal and written communications serving a wide variety of audiences: convey complex messages clearly and simply, raise important issues that need wider or more senior attention, integrate technical and non-technical topics seamlessly</li>
<li>Team player with a strong bias for action</li>
<li>Comfort with ambiguity, ability to create structure, creativity in problem solving, sense of “what matters” in every situation, ability to see simplicity on the far side of complexity</li>
<li>Aligned with our core values and excited about Indigo’s mission</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>6-8+ years’ work experience with both generalist-business responsibilities and technical responsibilities</li>
<li>Proven ability to build, lead, manage, and empower a high-performing, technical team</li>
<li>MBA/advanced degree preferred, industrial engineering experience in service-based environment a plus</li>
<li>Experience with customer experience measurement and tracking systems, e.g., NPS</li>
<li>Experience with at least two of the following: field operations, front-line enablement, behavioral psychology, cultural &amp; operational transformations</li>
<li>Experience managing complex and fast-paced projects with a high degree of ambiguity</li>
<li>Proven track record of working with business partners and technical partners to design, deliver, and improve operations</li>
<li>Experience with technical modeling</li>
<li>This role is based in Boston, some travel to be expected</li>
</ul>

<p>Indigo is committed to living our values, specifically “creating a work environment where everyone feels respected, connected, and has opportunities to learn and grow.” As part of living our values, we strive to create a diverse and inclusive work environment where everyone feels they can be themselves and has an equal opportunity of succeeding.</p>",Food & Beverage,Tech,,,,,Boston,MA,Other,,,,,,,,

Since 2014, Indigo has questioned agriculture's full value chain to improve grower profitability, environmental sustainability, and consumer health. The company’s scientific discoveries and digital innovations have amplified new value from soil to sale, benefiting more than 10,000 growers to date. Indigo is also the company behind The Terraton Initiative, a global effort to drawdown one trillion tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide by unlocking the potential of agricultural soils. In 2019, Indigo was ranked #1 on CNBC’s Disruptor 50 list.

More recently, HRT has started down a path to expand the scope of its trading beyond its high-frequency origins. The firm has a current and future need to develop a more sophisticated pre-trade and post-trade risk management framework for this increased scope.</span></p>

<p><span>The Head of Risk Management will be responsible for HRT’s risk management framework across market risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, counter-party risk, and credit risk. The Head of Risk Management will review and update HRT’s risk systems across these disciplines in order to protect the firm and to ensure proper levels of risk exposure. The role includes leading the design and development of a multi-asset class, global portfolio risk management system. The right candidate will have expertise in trading and risk management techniques and an understanding of automated, systematic trading. You will collaborate with HRT’s senior leadership and trading teams in order to manage the firm's risk appetite and appropriately allocate capital.</span></p>

<li><span>Work with software development team to enhance the firm’s pre-trade and real-time, post-trade risk systems.</span></li>
<li><span>Develop the framework for monitoring liquidity risk, counterparty risk, and credit risk.  </span></li>
